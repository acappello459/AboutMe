        <p>Hey! My name is Adam Cappello. I'm 24 years old and I'm a student at the New York Code + Design Academy. I'm working towards becoming a web developer. Before this I was working at Shake Shack, they have the most amazing burgers, fries, and shakes! I just got married in August to my beautiful wife, Jenna. Together we have an adorable 2 year old dog named Patton and he's the love of my life.</p>

            <p>I grew up in a small town about 20 miles south of Rochester NY called Avon. There I was a three sport athlete, competing in football, wrestling, and baseball. I graduated high school in 2012 and went on to college. My freshman year I went to a local community college, after I transferred to SUNY Brockport. I joined the Pi Kappa Phi Fraternity while there and made some friendships that I will have forever.</p>

              <p>I graduated Brockport in 2016 and that summer I moved to Philadelphia with Jenna. She is a doctoral student at La Salle, we've been here for just over 2 years now. We moved in at the end of August and within 2 weeks we had Patton. We went to Jamaica for our honeymoon and it was a magical time. We will be vising again soon!</p>
